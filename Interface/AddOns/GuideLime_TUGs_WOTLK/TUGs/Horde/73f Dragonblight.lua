I am marking EVERY Elite quest and dungeons as optional in this guide. Especially on release you should do them!!! You'll easily find groups for elite quests and dungeons.

The following part is probably the most iconic Questline in the history of WoW. If youre "in a hurry" I would recommend doing this quest after reaching level 80. If you want to do it later skip to "Use your Hearthstone". If you want to do it now, continue as normal.
Fly to [F Warsong Hold]
TurnIn: [QT13242]
Accept: [QA13257]
Take the Portal to Orgrimmar
TurnIn: [QT13257]
Accept: [QA13266]
Take the portal to The Undercity.
TurnIn: [QT13266]
Accept: [QA13267]
The Undercity siege will start soon. Wait for Thrall to move. Stay close to the NPCs at all times as they make you way more powerful and basically invincible. Enjoy the roleplay-heavy storyline till the end.
TurnIn: [QT13267]
Use your [H] Hearthstone.
This is the last chance for doing all elite quests. I will list them here for a final time.
