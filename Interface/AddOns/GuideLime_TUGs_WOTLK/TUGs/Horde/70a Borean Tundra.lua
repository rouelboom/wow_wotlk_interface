I am marking EVERY Elite quest and dungeons as optional in this guide. Especially on release you should do them!!! You'll easily find groups for elite quests and dungeons.

There is a QUESTIE bug currently that says you need "Hero of the Mag'har" to accept "Hellscream's Vigil". Nothing we can du currently. Just accept it and continue with this questline,it will be "going away" soon :)
