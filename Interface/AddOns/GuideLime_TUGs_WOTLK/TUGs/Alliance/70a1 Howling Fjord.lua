I am marking EVERY Elite quest and dungeons as optional in this guide. Especially on release you should do them!!! You'll easily find groups for elite quests and dungeons.
I assume you know how to get to Valgarde Keep, but here a short info: Fly to Menethil Harbor, Wetlands. Take the boat on the northern pier to arrive at Valgarde Keep.
