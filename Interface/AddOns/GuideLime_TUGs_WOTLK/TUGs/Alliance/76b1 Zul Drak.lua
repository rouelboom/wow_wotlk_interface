I am marking EVERY Elite quest and dungeons as optional in this guide. Especially on release you should do them!!! You'll easily find groups for elite quests and dungeons.
In Zul Drak there is an arena-like Elite quest chain that is avaiable from level 75 on and has no requirement aside being 75. Immediately go out of your way to do it if you can!!! Almost 200k exp in like 10minutes!
