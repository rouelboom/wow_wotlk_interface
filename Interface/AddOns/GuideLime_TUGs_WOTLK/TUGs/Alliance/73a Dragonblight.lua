You will get a Ruby Beacon of the Dragon Queen. this can be used as a mount, so we dont turn in this quest for quite a while. Use it as often as you can.
The next steps make use of said Flying-Mount and are GROUP ELITE QUESTS, so I mark them as optional, yet you should do them! If you wanna/have to skip them,go to the next guide.
