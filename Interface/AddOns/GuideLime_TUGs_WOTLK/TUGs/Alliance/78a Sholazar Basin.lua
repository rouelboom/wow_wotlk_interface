The Ring quest can be turned in whenever you found it, I will only put a "turnIn" marker at the end of Sholazar Basin, but you should turn it in as soon as you find it and are nearby the camp anyway.

I dont think I need to tell you, but use your flying mount from now on: Little tip: Make a macro: /use FlyingMountName /Use GroundMountName. This will make you mount up on your flying if you can fly and if you cant fly it will use the ground mount!
